# Backstage

## Prerequisites

- Node (>= 16), npm and npx installed
- docker and kind available

## Instructions

Here are the steps I followed to install backstage on a k8s cluster according to the backstage documentation
and feedback that I got from the backstage engineers

Open a terminal and execute this command within the folder where you want to launch backstage
```bash
npx @backstage/create-app
npx: installed 70 in 12.614s
? Enter a name for the app [required] my-backstage
...
ðŸ¥‡  Successfully created my-backstage

 All set! Now you might want to:
  Run the app: cd my-backstage && yarn dev
  Set up the software catalog: https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/configuration
  Add authentication: https://backstage.io/docs/auth/
```
When the `yarn build` is over, move to the folder of the created project and test it locally using the URL `http://localhost:3000/`
```bash
cd my-backstage && yarn dev
```

Next, build it like the backend image and upload it within your local registry (or kind cluster)
```bash
#yarn add --cwd packages/app graphql-ws
yarn build
yarn build-image -t backstage:dev
kind load docker-image backstage:dev
```

When the image has been uploaded we can create the YAML values file used by the Helm chart to install backstage on a k8s cluster

```bash
git clone https://github.com/backstage/backstage.git
cd contrib/chart/backstage
helm dependency update

helm install --create-namespace -f $HOME/code/backstage/my-values.yml -n backstage backstage .
```
To uninstall the chart
```bash
helm uninstall backstage -n backstage
```
